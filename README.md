This platform allows athletes, coaches, and analysts to compare video footage from multiple outings alongside biomechanics data. The goal is to bridge the gap between visual delivery analysis and quantitative biomechanical metrics, enabling smarter player development decisions.

With side-by-side video playback, synchronized overlays, and data-driven insights, users can track how mechanical changes translate into measurable performance outcomes. It can be used in conjunction with Kinovea, allowing you to import kinematic CSV data (joint angles, velocities, timing markers, etc.) directly into the platform for synchronized video + data analysis.

Features

Multi-Outing Video Comparison
Upload or link videos from different sessions, games, or bullpen outings. Compare mechanics frame-by-frame.

Biomech Data Integration
Pair video with biomechanics metrics (joint angles, velocities, kinematics, etc.).

Synchronized Playback
Videos align on key delivery moments (e.g., foot strike, max external rotation, ball release).

Metric Overlays
View biomechanical data as overlays on video timelines (release height, torque loads, etc.).

Progress Tracking
Detect trends across outings â€” e.g., arm slot consistency, stride length changes, or rotational energy transfer.
